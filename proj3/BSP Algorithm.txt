BSP Algorithm
1. Create a binary tree with the board as its root.
Build a tree data structure.
class Node
		- region
		- left, right

2. Split the board into half at random direction and position if size is valid and add the two halves to the children nodes.
   - size threshold?
	- An m times n room takes (m+2) times (n+2) spaces (with wall).
	- Set a min and max size for rooms.
	- The region should be greater than or equal to (min+2) times (min+2)
   - how to represent a region
	- int[][] use coordinate of two corners
	- int[] use coordinate of bottom-left corner together with width and height

3. Recursively split regions until all leaves reach size threshold.
4. Generate a room at random for each leaf region.
	- Generate a rectangular with random width, height and position.
	- Add wall to the surrounding.


5. At each level, for each pair of leaves, connect the two rooms with a corridor.
	- Randomly choose a room in each side respectively.
	- Add a path between these rooms.
	- May encounter another existing path.

6. Recursively climb up and connect until we reach the root.
