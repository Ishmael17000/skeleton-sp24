BSP Algorithm Procedure Summary

1. Create a binary tree with the board as its root.
Build a tree data structure.
class Node
		- int[][] region
		- Node left, Node right
		- int[][] room

2. Split the board into half at random direction and position if size is valid and
   add the two halves to the children nodes.
   - size threshold?
	- An m times n room takes (m+2) times (n+2) spaces (with wall).
	- Set a min and max size for rooms.
	- The region should be greater than or equal to (min+2) times (min+2)
    Use the coordinate of two corners (int[][]) to represent a region.

3. Recursively split regions until all leaves reach size threshold.

4. Generate a room at random for each leaf region.
	- Generate a rectangular with random width, height and position.
	- Add wall to the surrounding.


5. At each tree level, for each pair of sister nodes, connect the two regions with a corridor.
    - Randomly choose a room in each region respectively.
	- Add a path between these rooms.

	This part is somehow tricky:

	First, how do we know the set of points we are choosing from?
	    To avoid excessively random and winding paths, we should connect rooms in adjacent
	    leaves.
	    ## Choose two rooms with the least parallel distance?


	Next, which side should we choose to open a door?
	    The side cannot be chosen totally at random.
	    Suppose we are connecting the two rooms (x stands for wall)

	    x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x
        @           x @               x
        x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x

        If one door is on the leftmost, and the other is in the middle (marked with @),
        then there's no way to lead a path.

        Hence, we have to take care by choosing the adjacent sides.
        Given two sister regions, we first detect whether they are spared apart horizontally
        or vertically. Then we choose the corresponding sides to open random doors.
        There's a special case when the walls on two sides are adjacent (like the picture above).
        In this case we have to take adjacent doors.



6. Recursively climb up and connect until we reach the root.
